# PROGETTO FVAB
This repository focuses on detecting deepfake videos by analyzing facial dynamics, specifically temporal facial movements that are difficult to replicate in synthetic content.

# Approach:
CNN-LSTM: Combines CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dynamics in facial movements.

# Features:
Data Preprocessing: Extracts facial landmarks and key facial points.

# Model Training
Utilizes deep learning models for classification.

# Evaluation
Results are assessed using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and MSE.

# Tools
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy

# Environment
Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab for cloud-based execution.

#Files:
Python scripts (.py or .ipynb)

# Preprocessed data and trained models
Celeb DF (v2)
